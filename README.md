ElasticMS in Docker containers

# Build

## Prerequisite

You must install `make`, `m4`.

## Generate Dockerfile

```sh
make Dockefile
```

## Build locally Docker images

```sh
make build[-dev|-all] ELASTICMS_ADMIN_VERSION=<ElasticMS Admin Version you want to build> [ DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME=<ElasticMS Admin Docker Image Name you want to build> ]
```

## Example building __prd__ Docker image

```sh
make build ELASTICMS_ADMIN_VERSION=5.1.2
```

__Provide docker image__ : `docker.io/elasticms/admin:5.1.2-prd`

## Example building __dev__ Docker image

```sh

# Test

## Prerequisite

You must install `bats`, `awscli`, `docker`, `docker-compose` and create a local network called `docker_default`.  

## Test Docker images builded locally

```sh
make test[-dev|-all] ELASTICMS_ADMIN_VERSION=<ElasticMS Admin Version you want to test>
```

## Example testing of __prd__ builded docker image

```sh
make test ELASTICMS_ADMIN_VERSION=5.1.2
```

## Example testing of __dev__ builded docker image

```sh
make test-dev ELASTICMS_ADMIN_VERSION=5.1.2
